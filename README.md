# PhD Pathways

## Introduction

Welcome to the my first project, part of the Code Institute Full Stack Development Course. The purpose of this project is to build a responsive website using HTML, CSS only.

PhD pathways is a project focused on providing academics, with a particular focus for PhD students.

User will be able to navigate throught the website using a functional navigation bar. The website will include a careers section, positive testimonials from PhD graduates and a support section where visitors are able to click to explore resources available to them.

Thank you for visiting PhD pathways.

## UX - User Experience Design

The 5 planes of UX are the following:

The Strategy Plane
The Scope Plane
The Structure Plane
The Skeleton Plane
The Surface Plane

### The Strategy Plane

1. Creator Goals

- As a creator, I want a webpage to be easy to naviagte.

- As a creator, I want the webpage to be user-friendly and responsive. 

- As a creator, I want users to feel excited about the journey ahead, convey positive vibes, and mitigate anxious feelings.

2. User stories

- As a user, I want to navigate easily through the different sections of the webpage.

- As a user, I want content to be clear, I want links works well and to take me content that I want to be interested in.

### The Scope Plane.

For the website there were features I wanted to implement and other I was not able to achieve within the deadline.

**Features implemented upon webpage release**

- Header with a functional navigation bar, allowing users to navigate to different pages.

- A careers sections showing some of the options available to PhD graduates and hopefully highlighting the wide range of possibilities available.

- A testimonial sections including people's experiences having made the transition outside of academia in an attempt to convey ease and courage on the visitor.

- A support section including links to material available online to help them achieve their desired goals.

- A sign up page for then to inform on what resurces they feel they would find helpful.

### The Skeleton Plane

The more I worked on the project the more than some ideas developed while others were removed.

Header wireframes
--------------------
- The navigation bar has been moved to the left side on mobile devices to keep the navbar tidy and more user-friendly.
- The elements on the navigation bar will direct the user towards the section of interest to make the website more user-friendly.

Resource wireframes
--------------------
- The careers and support content has been displayed as an in-line block for easier visualization and access.
- The header in testimonials is displayed on the right and left of the page alternatively in an attempt to keep user engage by having something slightly different. 
- The support section have links displayed below the images shown which will direct the user towards the content that hopefully will find useful.
