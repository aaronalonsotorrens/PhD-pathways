Introduction

Welcome to the my first project, part of the Code Institute Full Stack Development Course. The purpose of this project is to build a responsive website using HTML, CSS only.

PhD pathways is a project focused on providing academics, with a particular focus for PhD students.

User will be able to navigate throught the website using a functional navigation bar. The website will include a careers section, positive testimonials from PhD graduates and a support section where visitors are able to click to explore resources available to them.

Thank you for visiting PhD pathways.
